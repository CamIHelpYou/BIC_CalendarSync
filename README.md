# BIC_CalendarSync

Will need the following libraries installed:
    import datetime
    import re
    from googleapiclient.discovery import build
    from httplib2 import Http
    from oauth2client import file, client, tools
    import getpass
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

Will also need to visit: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python to create a 'credentials.json' file to use the google calendar APIs
