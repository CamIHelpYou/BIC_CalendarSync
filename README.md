# BIC_CalendarSync

### Purpose: 
This script parses the HTML information from xCal for BICs, sorts this information, and pushes to a set of defined Google Calendars through Google Calendar's APIs. <br />

Will also need to visit: https://developers.google.com/calendar/quickstart/python to create a 'credentials.json' file to use the google calendar APIs<br />
NOTE*: Google calendar APIs will have the same permissions as the user who created the credentials.json
